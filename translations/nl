msgid "IfcDoorLiningProperties_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The door lining is the frame which enables the door leaf to be fixed in position. The door lining is used to hang the door leaf. The parameters of the door lining define the geometrically relevant parameter of the lining. NOTE The [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] shall only be applied by the receiving application to parametrically define the 3D shape of a door, if the attribute [[IfcDoorType]] .ParameterTakesPrecedence is set TRUE. The [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] are included in the list of properties of [[IfcDoorType]] .HasPropertySets. More information about the door lining can be included in the same list of the IfcDoorTyype using another [[IfcPropertySet]] for dynamic extensions. The [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] does not hold its own geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the door type which is inserted by the [[IfcDoor]] into the spatial context of the project as shown in Figure 1. The parameters of the [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] define a standard door lining, including if given a threshold and a transom. The outer boundary of the lining is determined by the Profile shape representation assigned to the [[IfcDoor]] , which inserts the [[IfcDoorType]] . The lining is applied to the left, right and upper side of the opening reveal. The parameters are LiningDepth, if omited, equal to wall thickness this only takes effect if a value for LiningThickness is given. If both parameters are not given, then there is no lining. LiningThickness LiningToPanelOffsetX LiningToPanelOffsetY NOTE The parameters LiningToPanelOffsetX and LiningToPanelOffsetY are added in IFC4. The lining can only cover part of the opening reveal. LiningOffset given if lining edge has an offset to the x axis of the local placement. NOTE In addition to the S LiningOffset, the local placement of the [[IfcDoor]] can already have an offset to the wall edge and thereby shift the lining along the y axis. The actual position of the lining is calculated from the origin of the local placement along the positive y axis with the distance given by LiningOffset. The lining may include a casing, which covers part of the wall faces around the opening. The casing covers the left, right and upper side of the lining on both sides of the wall. The parameters are CasingDepth CasingThickness The lining may include a threshold, which covers the bottom side of the opening. The parameters are ThresholdDepth if omited, equal to wall thickness this only takes effect if a value for ThresholdThickness is given. If both parameters are not given, then there is no threshold. ThresholdThickness ThresholdOffset not shown in figure given, if the threshold edge has an offset to the x axis of the local placement. The lining may have a transom which separates the door panel from a window panel. The transom, if given, is defined by TransomOffset a parallel edge to the x axis of the local placement TransomThickness The depth of the transom is identical to the depth of the lining and not given as separate parameter. Figure 1 Door lining properties NOTE LiningDepth describes the length of the lining along the reveal of the door opening. It can be given by an absolute value if the door lining has a specific depth depending on the door style. However often it is equal to the wall thickness. If the same door style is used like the same type of single swing door , but inserted into different walls with different thicknesses, it would be necessary to create a special door style for each wall thickness. Therefore several CAD systems allow to set the value to automatically aligned to wall thickness. This should be exchanged by leaving the optional attribute LiningDepth unassigned. The same agreement applies to ThresholdDepth . HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0.

msgid "IfcDoorPanelProperties_DEFINITION"
msgstr "A door panel is normally a door leaf that opens to allow people or goods to pass. The parameters of the door panel define the geometrically relevant parameter of the panel, The [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] are used to parametrically describe the shape and operation of door panels. The parametric definition can be added solely or additionally to the explicit shape representation of the door. The [[IfcDoorType]] can define doors consisting of more then one panel. In this case, one instance of [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] has to be included for each door panel. The PanelPosition attribute, in conjunction with the [[IfcDoorStyle]].OperationType attribute, determines to which panel the [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] apply. The [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] are included in the list of properties , given by attribute HasPropertySets of the [[IfcDoorType]] . More information about the door panel can be included in the same list of the [[IfcDoorStyle]] using the [[IfcPropertySet]] for dynamic extensions. The [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] does not hold a geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the door type which is inserted by the [[IfcDoor]] into the spatial context of the project as shown in Figure 1. The parameters of the [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] define a standard door panel, including if given a proportional width to define non uniform double swing or sliding, or folding doors. The outer boundary of the panel is determined by the Profile shape representation assigned to the [[IfcDoor]] , which inserts the [[IfcDoorType]] . It has to take the lining parameter into account as well. The depth of the panel swinging, double acting, and sliding panels is defined by the PanelDepth parameter. PanelDepth For door operation types that include more than one panel, the width of at least one panel is given by a normalised ratio measure. It determines the width of that panel, which is defined as a ratio of the overall width of the door opening.

A door style defines the overall parameter of the door style and refers to the particular parameter of the lining and one or several panels through the [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] and the [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] . The door entity, [[IfcDoor]] , defines a particular occurrence of a door inserted in the spatial context of a project. The actual parameter of the door and or its shape is defined at the [[IfcDoorStyle]] , to which the [[IfcDoor]] is related by the inverse relationship IsDefinedBy pointing to IfcRelDefinedByType . The [[IfcDoorStyle]] also defines the particular attributes for the lining , [[IfcDoorLiningProperties]] , and panels, [[IfcDoorPanelProperties]] . The [[IfcDoorStyle]] defines the baseline geometry, or the representation map, for all occurrences of the door style, given by the [[IfcDoor]] , pointing to this style. The representation of the door style may be given by the agreed set of minimal parameters, defined for the door lining and the door panel s , or it may be given by a geometric representation used by the [[IfcRepresentationMap]] . The attribute ParameterTakesPrecedence decides, whether the set of parameters can be used to exactly represent the shape of the door style TRUE , or whether the attached [[IfcRepresentationMap]] holds the exact representation FALSE .

msgid "IfcWindowPanelProperties_DEFINITION"
msgstr "A window panel is a casement, that is, a component, fixed or opening, consisting essentially of a frame and the infilling. The infilling of a window panel is normally glazing. The way of operation is defined in the operation type. The [[IfcWindowPanelProperties]] are used to parametrically describe the shape and operation of window panels. The parametric definition can be added solely or additionally to the explicit shape representation of the window. The [[IfcWindowType]] can define windows consisting of more then one panel. In this case, one instance of [[IfcWindowPanelProperties]] has to be included for each window panel. The PanelPosition attribute, in conjunction with the [[IfcWindowType]] .OperationType attribute, determines to which panel the [[IfcWindowPanelProperties]] apply. The [[IfcWindowPanelProperties]] are included in the list of properties HasPropertySets of the [[IfcWindowStyle]] . More information about the window panel can be included in the same list of the [[IfcWindowType]] using the [[IfcPropertySet]] for dynamic extensions. The [[IfcWindowPanelProperties]] does not hold an own geometric representation. However it defines parameter, which can be used to create the shape of the [[IfcWindowType]] which is inserted by the [[IfcWindow]] into the spatial context of the project . The parameters at the [[IfcWindowPanelProperties]] define a standard window panel. The outer boundary of the lining is determined by the Profile shape representation assigned to the [[IfcWindow]] , which inserts the [[IfcWindowType]] . It has to take the lining parameter into account as well. The position of the window panel within the overall window is determined by the PanelPosition attribute. As shown in Figure 1, the panel is applied to the position within the lining as defined by the panel position attribute.

An [[IfcLagTime]] provides information about the time lag that exists between the predecessor and successor process in a sequence. The assertion of the time lag is optional for a sequence but for work schedules that specifically deal with processes occurring at particular times, it should be asserted. A lag time has a duration type. This allows the identification of whether elapsed time or work time is being measured where work time is the estimate of the time required to complete the process and elapsed time being the amount of time actually allocated to the process The form of measurement of the duration can be captured. Allowed values for this are MEASURED, PREDICTED or SIMULATED. The selection of this value depends on the use of the schedule. A NOTDEFINED value is also allowed. The value of the time lag may be selected as being either a percentage ratio or an actual time measure. If selected as a ratio, the percentage should apply to the duration of the predecessor process relating process such that e.g. a value of 0.5 50 would indicate that the successor task should start when the predecessor task is 50 complete if a START START sequence type is used or should wait for 50 of the duration of the predecessor process to have elapsed after the finish of the predecessor process in case of a FINISH START sequence type.

In regular time series data arrive predictably at predefined intervals. In irregular time series some or all time stamps do not follow a repetitive pattern and unpredictable bursts of data may arrive at unspecified points in time. The modeling of buildings and their performance involves data that are generated and recorded over a period of time. Such data cover a large spectrum, from weather data to schedules of all kinds to status measurements to reporting to everything else that has a time related aspect. Their correct placement in time is essential for their proper understanding and use, and the [[IfcTimeSeries]] subtypes provide the appropriate data structures to accommodate these types of data.

The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional EC A series and VVG Low loss ballasts EC B series . Low loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load.

msgid "IfcClassification_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcClassification]] is used for the arrangement of objects into a class or category according to a common purpose or their possession of common characteristics. A classification in the sense of [[IfcClassification]] is taxonomy, or taxonomic scheme, arranged in a hierarchical structure. A category of objects relates to other categories in a generalization specialization relationship. Therefore the classification items in an classification are organized in a tree structure. The [[IfcClassification]] identifies the classification system or source to which a classification reference refers to. Each classification reference may reference an instance of [[IfcClassification]] . A classification system declared may be either formally published, or it may be a locally defined method of classifiying information. NOTE Examples for such formally published classifications are Omniclass, Uniclass, Masterformat, or DIN277. There are two methods to define and reference a classification system 1. Including the classification system structure within the dataset Here a hierarchical tree of [[IfcClassificationReference]] s is included that defines the classification system including the relationship between the classification items. The ReferencedSource attribute of [[IfcClassificationReference]] links the classification item to the parent item, and the parent item finally to the [[IfcClassification]] . 2. Referencing the classification system by a classification key or id Here the [[IfcClassificationReference]] is used to assign a classification id or key as Identification attribute and it may link by ReferencedSource attribute directly to the [[IfcClassification]] .

Name allows for a human interpretable designation of a classification notation. Location optionally holds a direct URI link into the classification system or source to hyperlink the classification key. The [[IfcClassificationReference]] can either be assigned directly to the [[IfcClassification]] , such as if no classification hierarchy has to be included, or it references the parent classification notation, if the fully classification hierarchy is included in the data set. The first is refered to as lightweight classification , and the second as full classification . The attribute ReferencedSource then holds the following information choice by [[IfcClassificationReferenceSelect]] 1. being of type [[IfcClassification]] direct reference to the classification system with meta information provided 2. being of type [[IfcClassificationReference]] reference to the parent classification notation within the classification hierarchy. EXAMPLE The [[IfcClassificationReference]] can be used as a form of lightweight classification through the Identification attribute inherited from the abstract [[IfcExternalReference]] class. In this case, the Identification could take for instance the Uniclass notation L6814 which, if the classification was well understood by all parties and was known to be taken from a particular classification source, would be sufficient.

msgstr "An individual axis, [[IfcGridAxis]] , is defined in the context of a design grid. The axis definition is based on a curve of dimensionality 2. The grid axis is positioned within the XY plane of the position coordinate system defined by the [[IfcGrid]] . The standard geometric representation of [[IfcGridAxis]] is defined using a 2D curve entity. Grid axes are normally defined by an offset to another axis. The [[IfcOffsetCurve2D]] supports this concept. Each grid axis has a sense given by the parameterization of the curve. The attribute SameSense is an indicator of whether or not the sense of the grid axis agrees with, or opposes, that of the underlying curve. As shown in Figure 1, the grid axis is defined as a 2D curve within the xy plane of the position coordinate system. Any curve can be used to define a grid axis, most common is the use of [[IfcLine]] for linear grids and [[IfcCircle]] for radial grids. Most grids are defined by a pair of axis lists, each defined by a base grid axis and axes given by an offset to the base axis. The use of [[IfcOffsetCurve2D]] as underlying AxisCurve supports this concept. Figure 1 Grid axis HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0 bSI Documentation"

msgid "IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An [[IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid]] is a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping an area along a Directrix . The swept area is provided by a subtype of [[IfcProfileDef]] . The profile is placed by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees to the tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile s x axis agrees to the FixedReference direction. The orientation of the curve during the sweeping operation is controlled by the FixedReference direction. The SweptArea is swept along the Directrix in such a way that the origin of the local coordinate system used to define the SweptArea is on the Directrix and the local X axis is in the direction of the projection of FixedReference onto the normal plane to the directrix at this point. The resulting solid has the property that the cross section of the surface by the normal plane to the Directrix at any point is a copy of the SweptArea . The resulting swept solid is placed by the Position coordinate system. The Directrix and the ReferenceSurface are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start of the sweeping operation is at the StartParam , the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no StartParam is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is at the EndParam , the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no EndParam is provided the end defaults to the end of the directrix. NOTE The StartParam and the EndParam are not normalized by default, they depend upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the [[IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment]] within an [[IfcCompositeCurve]] as the directrix allows to explicitly reparameterize the underlying sweeping curve. EXAMPLE The reference surface is any surface plane, cylindric, composite situated in 3D space and positioned in the object coordinate system. In many cases, it is a surface of extrusion. The directrix lies on the surface, often defined as a p curve at this reference surface. At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system lies at the directrix. The Axis3 the z axis, or normal of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix at this point, the Axis1 the x axis, or u of the position coordinate system is identical to the FixedReference direction. The Axis2 the y axis, or v is constructed. In this case the resulting swept solid is not repositioned. The orientation of the SweptArea as it sweeps along the Directrix is precisely defined by a CartesianTransformationOperator3d with attributes LocalOrigin as point 0 0 0 , Axis1 as the FixedReference . Axis3 as the direction of the tangent vector t at the point of the Directrix with parameter u . The remaining attributes are defaulted to define a corresponding transformation matrix T u , which varies with the Directrix parameter u . NOTE The geometric shape of the solid is not dependent upon the curve parameterization the volume depends upon the area swept and the length of the Directrix .

msgid "IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The [[IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid]] is the result of sweeping an area along a directrix that lies on a reference surface. The swept area is provided by a subtype of [[IfcProfileDef]] . The profile is placed by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees to the tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile s x axis agrees to the surface normal. At any point along the directrix, the swept profile origin lies on the directrix, the profile s normal points towards the tangent of the directrix, and the profile s x axis is identical to the surface normal at this point. NOTE The profile area s normal has to be identical to the tangent of the directrix at any given point. In case of a directrix having a linear segment at the start point, the segment has to be perpendicular to the profile at start. The Directrix and the ReferenceSurface are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start of the sweeping operation is at the StartParam , the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no StartParam is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is at the EndParam , the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no EndParam is provided the end defaults to the end of the directrix. The geometric shape of the solid is not dependent upon the curve parameterization the volume depends upon the area swept and the length of the Directrix . NOTE The StartParam and the EndParam are not normalized by default, they depend upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the [[IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment]] within an [[IfcCompositeCurve]] as the directrix allows to explicitly reparameterize the underlying sweeping curve. In case of a closed curve, such as [[IfcCircle]] or [[IfcEllipse]] , as the directrix, StartParam and the EndParam shall not exceed the parametic range, they shall not be 360 . EXAMPLE The reference surface is any surface plane, cylindric, composite situated in 3D space and positioned in the object coordinate system. In most cases, it is a plane or a surface of extrusion. The directrix lies on the surface, in case of a plane it might be defined as a polyline or composite curve, in case of a cylindrical or other non planer reference surface it might often be defined as a p curve on this reference surface. At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system of the implicit plane lies at the directrix. The Axis3 the z axis, or normal of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix at this point, the Axis1 the x axis, or u of the position coordinate system is identical to the normal of the reference surface at this point. The Axis2 the y axis, or v is constructed. The resulting body of the swept solid is not repositioned if the inherited Position attribute is omitted. Otherwise the coordinate system established by the Position attribute is used to reposition the body relative to the object coordinate system. EXAMPLE Figure 1 illustrates an example using a cylindrical reference surface and a p curve for sweeping a rectangle. The Postion is not provided and therefore it does not reposition the resulting swept solid. Figure 2 shows the expected result. NOTE The start of the directrix lies at the origin of the object coordinate system, as shown in the illustration, only by coincidence. The start of the directrix and thereby the start of the sweeping operation might be at any point within the object coordinate system and only depends on the position of the directrix. Figure 1 Surface curve wept area solid parameter Figure 2 Surface curve wept area solid results .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO CD 10303 42 1992 A surface curve swept area solid is a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping a face along a Directrix lying on a ReferenceSurface . The orientation of the SweptArea is related to the direction of the surface normal. The SweptArea is required to be a curve bounded surface lying in the plane z 0 and this is swept along the Directrix in such a way that the origin of the local coordinate system used to define the SweptArea is on the Directrix and the local x axis is in the direction of the normal to the ReferenceSurface at the current point. The resulting solid has the property that the cross section of the surface by the normal plane to the Directrix at any point is a copy of the SweptArea . The orientation of the SweptArea as it sweeps along the Directrix is precisely defined by a Cartesian Transformation Operator 3D with attributes Local origin as point 0., 0., 0 , Axis 1 as the normal N to the reference surface at the point of the directrix with parameter u.

The coordinates of each point are provided by a one based index into an ordered list of Cartesian points provided by the two dimensional list CoordIndex , where the first dimension of the two dimensional list addresses the list of triangular faces the second dimension of the two dimensional list provides exactly three indices. Each index points to a Cartesian point being a vertex of the triangle. Depending on the provision of PnIndex the indices point either directly into the [[IfcCartesianPointList3D]] referenced by Coordinates defined at the supertype [[IfcTessellatedFaceSet]] , or they point into the PnIndex where the integer values at that position provides the location of the coordinate values within the [[IfcCartesianPointList3D]] .

NOTE In case of a body representation having triangular faces with curvature, different normals for all three vertices in context of this triangles are exported, describing the curvature for smooth visualisation. In case of triangular faces with no curvature, the three vertex based normals are identical and could always be computed from the face.

The list of normalized vectors u defines the columns of an orthogonal matrix T. These vectors are computed, by the base axis function, from the direction attributes axis1, axis2 and, in Cartesian transformation operator 3d, axis3. If T 1 , the transformation includes mirroring. The local origin point A , the scale value S and the matrix T together define a transformation. The transformation for a point with position vector P is defined by P A S TP The transformation for a direction d is defined by d Td The transformation for a vector with orientation d and magnitude k is defined by d Td, and k Sk For those entities whose attributes include an axis2 placement, the transformation is applied, after the derivation, to the derived attributes p defining the placement coordinate directions. For a transformed surface, the direction of the surface normal at any point is obtained by transforming the normal, at the corresponding point, to the original surface. For geometric entities with attributes such as the radius of a circle which have the dimensionality of length, the values will be multiplied by S . For curves on surface the p curve.reference to curve will be unaffected by any transformation.

NOTE Since the BasisCurve is closed type [[IfcCircle]] , the exception of the informal proposition IP3 applies, i.e. the sense flag is not required to be consistent with the parameter values of Trim1 and Trim1 , so the rule sense parameter 1 parameter 2 may not be fulfilled. .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO CD 10303 42 1992 A trimmed curve is a bounded curve which is created by taking a selected portion, between two identified points, of the associated basis curve. The basis curve itself is unaltered and more than one trimmed curve may reference the same basis curve. Trimming points for the curve may be identified by parametric value geometric position both of the above At least one of these shall be specified at each end of the curve. The SenseAgreement makes it possible to unambiguously define any segment of a closed curve such as a circle. The combinations of sense and ordered end points make it possible to define four distinct directed segments connecting two different points on a circle or other closed curve. For this purpose cyclic properties of the parameter range are assumed for example, 370 degrees is equivalent to 10 degrees. The [[IfcTrimmedCurve]] has a parameterization which is inherited from the particular basis curve reference. More precisely the parameter s of the trimmed curve is derived from the parameter of the basis curve as follows if SenseAgreement is TRUE s t t X 7E1 X 7E if SenseAgreement is FALSE s t X 7E2 X 7E t In the above equations t X 7E1 X 7E is the value given by Trim1 or the parameter value corresponding to point 1 and t X 7E2 X 7E is the value given by Trim2 or the parameter value corresponding to point 2. The resultant [[IfcTrimmedCurve]] has a parameter ranging from 0 at the first trimming point to t X 7E2 X 7E t X 7E1 X 7E at the second trimming point. NOTE In case of a closed curve, it may be necessary to increment t1 or t2 by the parametric length for consistency with the sense flag. NOTE Entity adapted from trimmed curve defined in ISO 10303 42 HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0 .spec head Informal Propositions 1. Where both the parameter value and the Cartesian point exist for Trim1 and Trim2 they shall be consistent. i.e., the BasisCurve evaluated at the parameter value shall coincide with the specified point . 2. When a Cartesian point is specified by Trim1 or by Trim2 it shall lie on the BasisCurve . 3. Except the case of a closed BasisCurve where both parameter 1 and parameter 2 exist, they shall be consistent with the sense flag, i.e., sense parameter 1 parameter 2 . Or, for every open curve where both parameter 1 and parameter 2 exist, they shall be consistent with the SenseAgreement , i.e., SenseAgreement parameter 1 parameter 2 . 4. If both parameter 1 and parameter 2 exist, then parameter 1 parameter 2. For a closed base curve, e.g. [[IfcCircle]] or [[IfcEllipse]] , this also applies to the cyclic properties, as 360 is equal to 0 , parameter 1 360 and parameter 2 0 are treated as being equal and therefore violating this proposition. 5.

Therefore a group is an aggregation under some non geometrical topological grouping aspects. EXAMPLE An example for a group is a system, since it groups elements under the aspect of their role, regardless of their position in a building. One of the most important usage of a group representing a system is the [[IfcDistributionSystem]] , that groups distribution components, such as space heaters and valves into a heating system. A group can hold any collection of objects, the relationship [[IfcRelAssignsToGroup]] is used to establish the group collection. Objects within a group are S products, processes, controls, resources, actors or other groups, thus groups can be nested. An object can be part of zero, one, or many groups. Grouping relationships are not required to be hierarchical nor do they imply a dependency. Groups are assigned to other objects such as a process or a resource by the relationship object that refers to the corresponding object Process assigned using [[IfcRelAssignsToProcess]] Resource assigned using [[IfcRelAssignsToResource]] Controls affecting the group using [[IfcRelAssignsToControl]] A group can be exchanged without having already objects within the group collection. [[IfcGroup]] does not define an own object coordinate system, nor does it have an independent shape representation. NOTE Use [[IfcRelAggregates]] together with the appropriate subtypes of [[IfcProduct]] to define an aggregation of products that may have its own position and shape representation. This relationship shall be used to create a product breakdown structure.

msgstr "An [[IfcObjectDefinition]] is the generalization of any semantically treated thing or process, either being a type or an occurrences. Object defintions can be named, using the inherited Name attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object occurrance. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited Description attribute. A context is a specific kind of object definition as it provides the project or library context in which object types and object occurrences are defined. Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are four essential kinds of relationships in which object definitons by their instantiable subtypes can be involved Assignment of other objects an assignment relationship [[IfcRelAssigns]] that refers to other types of objects and creates a bi directional association. The semantic of the assignment is established at the level of the subtypes of the general [[IfcRelAssigns]] relationship. There is no dependency implied a priori by the assignment. Association to external resources an association relationship [[IfcRelAssociates]] that refers to external sources of information most notably a classification or document and creates a uni directional association. There is no dependency implied by the association. Aggregation of other objects an aggregation relationship [[IfcRelAggregates]] that establishes an unordered, spatial whole part relation and creates a bi directional relation.

An [[IfcProduct]] occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The ObjectPlacement attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under Representation are founded. The Representation is provided by an [[IfcProductDefinitionShape]] being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation with or without underlying geometry of the topological items . Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects referred to as elements for incorporation into an AEC FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations. In addition to physical products covered by the subtype [[IfcElement]] and spatial items covered by the subtype [[IfcSpatialElement]] the [[IfcProduct]] also includes non physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc. Any instance of [[IfcProduct]] defines a particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates to many similar or identical occurrences of [[IfcProduct]] , is handled by the [[IfcTypeProduct]] and its subtypes , assigned to one or many occurrences of [[IfcProduct]] by using the objectified relationship [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] .

The ProxyType may give an indication to which high level semantic breakdown of object the semantic definition of the proxy relates to. the Tag attribute may be used to assign a human or system interpretable identifier such as a serial number or bar code . NOTE Given that only a limited number of semantic constructs can be formally defined within IFC and it will never be possible to define all , there has to be a mechanism for capturing those constructs that are not yet defined by IFC.

These quantity sets are listed as quantity sets within this specification. Quantity sets applicable to certain objects are listed in the object specification. An [[IfcPropertySetTemplate]] may define the underlying structure, i.e. the required name, the applicable object or object types to which the quantity set can be attached, and the individual quantities that maybe included.

msgstr "[[IfcResource]] contains the information needed to represent the costs, schedule, and other impacts from the use of a thing in a process. It is not intended to use [[IfcResource]] to model the general properties of the things themselves, while an optional linkage from [[IfcResource]] to the things to be used can be specified specifically, the relationship from subtypes of [[IfcResource]] to [[IfcProduct]] through the [[IfcRelAssignsToResource]] relationship . There are two basic intended uses of [[IfcResource]] . First, if the attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of [[IfcResource]] , or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn t have to be instantiated in the system. That is, the attributes of [[IfcResource]] or its subtypes alone are sufficient to represent the use of the thing as a resource for the purpose of the project. EXAMPLE construction equipment such as earth moving vehicles or tools are not currently modeled within the IFC. For the purpose of estimating and scheduling, these can be represented using subtypes of [[IfcResource]] alone. Second, if the attributes of the thing are needed for the use of [[IfcResource]] objects, and they are modeled explicitly as objects, then the [[IfcResource]] instances can be linked to the instances of the type of the things being referenced.

The location of material layer set shall be compatible with the building element geometry that is, material layers shall fit inside the element geometry . The rules to ensure the compatibility depend on the type of the building element. EXAMPLE S For a cavity brick wall with shape representation SweptSolid, the [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]].TotalThickness shall be equal to the wall thickness. Also the OffsetFromReferenceLine shall match the exact positions between the two shape representations of [[IfcWallStandardCase]] , that is the [[IfcShapeRepresentation]] s with RepresentationIdentifier Axis and RepresentationIdentifier Body . NOTE S Model view definitions or implementer agreements may provide more instructions on matching between building element geometry and material layer set usage. The [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] is always assigned to an individual occurrence object and only to relevant subtypes of [[IfcElement]] . The [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] , referenced by ForLayerSet , can however be shared among several occurrence objects. If the element type is available in other words, an instance of the relevant subtype of [[IfcElementType]] exists , then the [[IfcMaterialLayerSet]] can be assigned to the element type. The assignment between a S subtype of [[IfcElement]] and the [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] is handled by [[IfcRelAssociatesMaterial]] . .use head Attribute use definition The [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] is primarily intended to be associated with planar building elements having a constant thickness. With further agreements on the interpretation of LayerSetDirection , the usage can be extended also to other cases, for example to curved building elements, provided that the material layer thicknesses are constant. Generally, an element may be layered in any of its primary directions, denoted by its x, y or z axis. The geometry use definitions at each S specific type of building element will determine the applicable S LayerSetDirection . The following examples illustrate how the [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] attributes LayerSetDirection , DirectionSense , OffsetFromReferenceLine can be used in different cases. Normative material use definitions are documented at each element how these shall be used . Figure 1 shows an example of the use of [[IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage]] aligned to the axis of a wall. EXAMPLE For a standard wall with extruded geometric representation vertical extrusion , the layer set direction will be perpendicular to extrusion direction, and S can be derived from the direction of the wall axis. With the DirectionSense positive in this example the individual IfcMaterialLayers are assigned consecutively right to left or left to right. For a curved wall, direction denoting the wall thickness can be derived from the direction of the wall axis, and it will remain perpendicular to the wall path. The DirectionSense applies as well.

In this example, the material layer set base is the extruded profile and consistent with the [[IfcExtrudedAreaSolid]].Position , S with the DirectionSense being positive, the individual IfcMaterialLayers are built up from the base towards the positive z direction in this case.

The [[IfcFillAreaStyle]] defines hatches as model hatches, that is, the distance between hatch lines, or the curve patterns of hatch lines are given in model space dimensions that have to be scaled using the target plot scale . The [[IfcFillAreaStyle]] allows for the following combinations of defining the style of hatching and tiling Solid fill for areas and surfaces by only assigning [[IfcColour]] to the set of FillStyles . It then provides the background colour for the filled area or surface. NOTE Color information of surfaces for rendering is assigned by using [[IfcSurfaceStyle]] , not by using [[IfcFillAreaStyle]] .

msgid "IfcFillAreaStyleHatching_DEFINITION"
msgstr "The [[IfcFillAreaStyleHatching]] is used to define simple, vector based hatching patterns, based on styled straight lines. The curve font, color and thickness is given by the HatchLineAppearance , the angle by the HatchLineAngle and the distance to the next hatch line by StartOfNextHatchLine , being either an offset distance or a vector. .extDef NOTE Definition according to ISO 10303 46 The fill area style hatching defines a styled pattern of curves for hatching an annotation fill area or a surface. NOTE If the hatch pattern involves two potentially crossing rows of hatch lines, then two instances of [[IfcFillAreaStyleHatching]] should be assigned to the [[IfcFillAreaStyle]] . Both share the same virtual point of origin of the hatching that is used by the reference hatch line or the PointOfReferenceHatchLine if there is an offset . For better control of the hatching appearance, when using hatch lines with other fonts then continuous, the PatternStart allows to offset the start of the curve font pattern along the reference hatch line if not given, the PatternStart is at zero distance from the virtual point of origin . If the reference hatch line does not go through the origin of the virtual hatching coordinate system , it can be offset by using the PatternStart . NOTE The coordinates of the PatternStart are given relative to the origin of the object coordinate of [[IfcAnnotationFillArea]] , or if present, the FillAreaTarget attribute of [[IfcAnnotationFillArea]] . The measure values are given in global drawing length units, representing a model hatching, and can be translated into drawing units by the TargetScale for a scale depended IfcGeometricRepresentationSubcontext , if provided. .deprecated DEPRECATION The use of PointOfReferenceHatchLine is deprecated. Figure 1 illustrates hatch attributes. Example 1 This example shows simple hatching given by using a curve font continuous at HatchLineAppearance. The distance of hatch lines is given by a positive length measure. The angle here 45 if measures in degree is provided by HatchLineAngle. The PatternStart is set to NIL in this example. Example 2 This shows hatching from example 1 with using a different curve font at HatchLineAppearance. The distance of hatch lines is given by a positive length measure, therefore the font pattern start is at a point at the next hatch line given by a vector being perpendicular to the point of origin at the reference hatch line. The PatternStart is set to NIL in this example. Example 3 This example uses hatching from example 2 with a vector to determine the pattern start of the next hatch lines. The pattern start is the beginning of the first visual curve font pattern segment at IfcCurveFont.CurveFont. The PatternStart is set to NIL in this example. Example 4 This example uses hatching from example 3 where the pattern start is offset from the point of origin at the reference hatch line. That is, the first visible curve font pattern segment now does not start at the point of origin at the reference hatch line. Example 5 This example uses hatching from example 4 where the hatch pattern is shifted against the underlying coordinate system. The point that is mapped to the insertion point of the IfcAnnotationFillAreaOccurrence now has an X and Y offset from the start of the reference hatch line. That is, the reference hatch line now does not go through the insertion point of the hatching. Example 6 This example shows use of [[IfcFillAreaStyleHatching]] attributes for two [[IfcFillAreaStyleHatching]] s within one [[IfcFillAreaStyle]]. Note that the PatternStart now displaces both the reference hatch line from the point of origin and the start of the curve pattern. This can be used in cases when more than one [[IfcFillAreaStyleHatching]] is used in an [[IfcFillAreaStyle]] in order to place rows of hatch lines with an offset from each other.

In contrary to the [[IfcImageTexture]] the [[IfcPixelTexture]] holds a 2 dimensional list of pixel color and opacity directly, instead of referencing to an URL. The following definitions from ISO IEC 19775 1 X3D Architecture and base components X3D Specification http www.web3d.org x3d specifications apply The PixelTexture node defines a 2D image based texture map as an explicit array of pixel values image field and parameters controlling tiling repetition of the texture onto geometry. Texture maps are defined in a 2D coordinate system s, t that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 in both directions. The bottom edge of the pixel image corresponds to the S axis of the texture map, and left edge of the pixel image corresponds to the T axis of the texture map. The lower left pixel of the pixel image corresponds to s 0.0, t 0.0, and the top right pixel of the image corresponds to s 1.0, t 1.0. The Image field specifies a single uncompressed 2 dimensional pixel image. Image fields contain three integers representing the width, height and number of components in the image, followed by width height hexadecimal values representing the pixels in the image. Pixel values are limited to 256 levels of intensity that is, 0x00 0xFF hexadecimal . 1. A one component image specifies one byte hexadecimal value representing the intensity of the image. For example, 0xFF is full intensity in hexadecimal 255 in decimal , 0x00 is no intensity 0 in decimal . 2. A two component image specifies the intensity in the first high byte and the alpha opacity in the second low byte. 3. Pixels in a three component image specify the red component in the first high byte, followed by the green and blue components for example, 0xFF0000 is red, 0x00FF00 is green, 0x0000FF is blue . 4. Four component images specify the alpha opacity byte after red green blue e.g., 0x0000FF80 is semi transparent blue . A value of 00 is completely transparent, FF is completely opaque, 80 is semi transparent. Note that alpha equals 1.0 transparency , if alpha and transparency each range from 0.0 to 1.0.

Texture map A texture plus the general parameters necessary for mapping the texture to geometry. Texture are defined by 2D images that contain an array of colour values describing the texture. The texture values are interpreted differently depending on the number of components in the texture and the specifics of the image format. In general, texture may be described using one of the following forms 1. Intensity textures one component 2. Intensity plus alpha opacity textures two component 3. Full RGB textures three component 4. Full RGB plus alpha opacity textures four component NOTE Image formats specify an alpha opacity, not transparency where alpha 1 transparency .

The bottom edge of the image corresponds to the S axis of the texture map, and left edge of the image corresponds to the T axis of the texture map. The lower left pixel of the image corresponds to s 0, t 0, and the top right pixel of the image corresponds to s 1, t 1. Texture maps may be viewed as two dimensional colour functions that, given an s, t coordinate, return a colour value colour s, t . If multiple surface textures are included in the [[IfcSurfaceStyleWithTextures]] applying them to a geometric item, a mode and optional parameters can be included that blending operations. The RepeatS and RepeatT Boolean flags control whether the texture map is repeated outside the 0.0, 1.0 texture coordinate range, when applied to a geometric surface, or clamped to lie within the 0.0, 1.0 range. The TextureTransform applies a 2D non uniform transformation to the texture before it is applied to a geometric surface. The following definitions from ISO IEC 19775 1 X3D Architecture and base components X3D Specification http www.web3d.org x3d specifications apply These parameters support changes to the size, orientation, and position of textures on shapes. Note that these operations appear reversed when viewed on the surface of geometry. For example, a scale value of 2 2 will scale the texture coordinates and have the net effect of shrinking the texture size by a factor of 2 texture coordinates are twice as large and thus cause the texture to repeat . A translation of 0.5 0.0 translates the texture coordinates .5 units along the S axis and has the net effect of translating the texture 0.5 along the S axis on the geometry s surface. A rotation of π 2 of the texture coordinates results in a π 2 rotation of the texture on the geometry. The center field specifies a translation offset in texture coordinate space about which the rotation and scale fields are applied. The scale field specifies a scaling factor in S and T of the texture coordinates about the center point. scale values shall be in the range , . The rotation field specifies a rotation in radians of the texture coordinates about the center point after the scale has been applied. A positive rotation value makes the texture coordinates rotate counterclockwise about the centre, thereby rotating the appearance of the texture itself clockwise. The translation field specifies a translation of the texture coordinates.

msgstr ".extDef Definition according to W3C for Cascading Style Sheets Setting font properties will be among the most common uses of style sheets. Unfortunately, there exists no well defined and universally accepted taxonomy for classifying fonts, and terms that apply to one font family may not be appropriate for others. For example, italic is commonly used to label slanted text, but slanted text may also be labeled as being Oblique , Slanted , Incline , Cursive or Kursiv . Therefore it is not a simple problem to map typical font selection properties to a specific font. .extDef Font matching Because there is no accepted, universal taxonomy of font properties, matching of properties to font faces must be done carefully. The properties are matched in a well defined order to ensure that the results of this matching process are as consistent as possible across user agents assuming that the same library of font faces is presented to each of them . 1. The user agent makes or accesses a database of relevant CSS1 properties of all the fonts of which the UA is aware. The UA may be aware of a font because it has been installed locally or it has been previously downloaded over the web. If there are two fonts with exactly the same properties, one of them is ignored. 2. At a given element and for each character in that element, the UA assembles the font properties applicable to that element. Using the complete set of properties, the UA uses the font family property to choose a tentative font family. The remaining properties are tested against the family according to the matching criteria described with each property. If there are matches for all the remaining properties, then that is the matching font face for the given element. 3. If there is no matching font face within the font family being processed by step 2, and if there is a next alternative font family in the font set, then repeat step 2 with the next alternative font family . 4. If there is a matching font face, but it doesn t contain a glyph for the current character, and if there is a next alternative font family in the font sets, then repeat step 2 with the next alternative font family . 5. If there is no font within the family selected in 2, then use a UA dependent default font family and repeat step 2, using the best match that can be obtained within the default font. The above algorithm can be optimized to avoid having to revisit the CSS1 properties for each character. The per property matching rules from 2 above are as follows 1. font style is tried first. italic will be satisfied if there is either a face in the UA s font database labeled with the CSS keyword italic preferred or oblique . Otherwise the values must be matched exactly or font style will fail. 2. font variant is tried next. normal matches a font not labeled as small caps small caps matches 1 a font labeled as small caps , 2 a font in which the small caps are synthesized, or 3 a font where all lowercase letters are replaced by upper case letters. A small caps font may be synthesized by electronically scaling uppercase letters from a normal font. 3. font weight is matched next, it will never fail. See font weight below. 4. font size must be matched within a UA dependent margin of tolerance. Typically, sizes for scalable fonts are rounded to the nearest whole pixel, while the tolerance for bitmapped fonts could be as large as 20 . Further computations, are based on the font size value that is used, not the one that is specified. The inherited Name attribute is used to define the font name, particularly in cases, where no list of font families are provided.

UserDefinedSequenceType attribute added. WHERE rule controlling use of the USERDEFINED enumeration added. .use head Use definitions [[IfcRelSequence]] is used to describe the logical sequence relationship that exists between two processes. This logical relationship identifies that there is a predecessor or relating process and a successor or related process. In IFC, there may be one predecessor and one successor in the relationship. Many occurrences of [[IfcRelSequence]] may exist to describe the sequence relationships of a predecessor task with many successor tasks or of many predecessor tasks with one successor task, thus enabling a m n sequence relationship between tasks. Please note that sequence relationships can be used to define dependencies between process occurrences but also between process types for further information see [[IfcRelDefinesByObject]] and [[IfcTaskType]] . In case of defining dependencies between process occurrences sequence relationships should stay within the limits of a directed, non cyclic graph. A sequence type may be set for a sequence. For tasks assigned to a work schedule, it is expected that the sequence type will be asserted. For a process map, where the sequence relationship between processes is simply a logical flow, it need not be asserted. A time lag may be assigned to a sequence, and the sequence type defines the way in which the time lag applies to the sequence either as a ratio or percentage of time duration e.g. start successor task when predecessor is 50 complete or as a time measure e.g. start successor task 1 week after commencement of the predecessor task . Care should be used when assigning a time lag to a sequence depending on the setting of the sequence type since there is no checking that the time lag value is in keeping with the sequence type set. bSI Documentation"

This includes Order actions Move operations [[IfcTask]] represents an order that might be carried out by a Helpdesk acting the role of interface for the organization between the facility user and the functional requirement of fulfilling their needs. The actual task represented by the [[IfcTask]] entity is turning a request into an order and initiating the action that will enable the order to be completed. The [[IfcProjectOrder]] or one of its subtypes including maintenance work order, is related to the [[IfcTask]] using [[IfcRelAssignsToControl]] . [[IfcTask]] can also be used to describe an activity that moves people, groups within an organization or complete organizations together with their associated furniture and equipment from one place to another. It thus replaces the previous IFC entity IfcMove. The functionality is represented in [[IfcTask]] as follows Move from The place from which actors and their associated equipment are moving. Use [[IfcRelAssignsToProcess]] where RelatingProcess points to the task and RelatedObjects holds the location s from which to move.

The definition of time periods can be derived from a base calendar and or modified defined by a set of working times and non working exception times. All time periods defined by [[IfcWorkCalendar]].ExceptionTimes override the time periods inherited from the base calendar base calendar is defined as the next applicable calendar for the task or resource . Thus, exception times replace the working times from the base calendar. Figure 1 shows the definition of a work calendar, which is defined by a set of work times and exception times. The work times are defined as recurring patterns with optional boundaries applying from and or to a specific date . The shown example defines a simple work calendar with working times Monday to Thursday 8 00 to 12 00 and 13 00 to 17 00, Friday 8 00 to 14 00 and as exception every 1st Monday in a month the work starts one hour later i.e. the working time on every 1st Monday in a month is overriden to be 9 00 to 12 00 and 13 00 to 17 00. Both the working time and the exception time is valid for the period of 01.09.2010 till 30.08.2011. task type instantiation diagram .. .. .. .. .. .. figures ifcworkcalendar instantiation diagram.png Figure 1 Work calendar instantiation bSI Documentation"

msgid "IfcElement_DEFINITION"
msgstr "An element is a generalization of all components that make up an AEC product. Elements are physically existent objects, although they might be void elements, such as holes. Elements either remain permanently in the AEC product, or only temporarily, as formwork does. Elements can be either assembled on site or pre manufactured and built in on site. EXAMPLE Examples of elements in a building construction context are walls, floors, windows and recesses. The elements can be logically contained by a spatial structure element that constitutes a certain level within a project structure hierarchy site, building, storey or space . This is done by using the [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]] relationship. An element can have material and quantity information assigned through the [[IfcRelAssociatesMaterial]] and [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] relationship. In addition an element can be declared to be a specific occurrence of an element type and thereby be defined by the element type properties using the [[IfcRelDefinesByType]] relationship. An element can also be defined as an element assembly that is a group of semantically and topologically related elements that form a higher level part of the AEC product. Those element assemblies are defined by virtue of the [[IfcRelAggregates]] relationship. EXAMPLE Examples for element assembly are complete Roof Structures, made by several Roof Areas, or a Stair, composed by Flights and Landings. Elements that performs the same function may be grouped by an Element Group By Function . It is realized by an instance of [[IfcGroup]] with the ObjectType ElementGroupByFunction .

It is also used to connect a system to the relevant spatial element that it serves. NOTE The primary containment relationship between an element and the spatial structure is handled by [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]]. Any element can be referenced to zero, one or several levels of the spatial structure. Whereas the [[IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure]] relationship is required to be hierarchical an element can only be contained in exactly one spatial structure element , the [[IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure]] is not restricted to be hierarchical. EXAMPLE A wall might be normally contained within a storey, and since it does not span through several stories, it is not referenced in any additional storey. However a curtain wall might span through several stories, in this case it can be contained within the ground floor, but it would be referenced by all additional stories, it spans. Predefined spatial structure elements to which elements can be assigned are site as [[IfcSite]] facility as [[IfcFacility]] or its subtypes [[IfcBridge]], [[IfcBuilding]], [[IfcMarineFacility]], [[IfcRailway]] or [[IfcRoad]] part of facility as IfcFaciltityPart, or more specifically as [[IfcBuildingStorey]] or [[IfcSpace]] Elements can also be references in a spatial zone that is provided as [[IfcSpatialZone]].

In the case of a physical space boundary, the placement and shape of the boundary may be given, and the building element, providing the boundary, is referenced, In the case of a virtual space boundary, the placement and shape of the boundary may be given, and a virtual element is referenced. The [[IfcRelSpaceBoundary]] is defined as an objectified relationship that handles the element to space relationship by objectifying the relationship between an element and the space it bounds. It is given as a one to one relationship, but allows each element including virutal elements and openings to define many such relationship and each space to be defined by many such relationships. Space boundaries are always defined as seen from the space. In general two basic types of space boundaries are distinguished 1 st level space boundary defined as boundaries of the space, not taking into account any change in building element or spaces on the other side. 2 nd level space boundary defined as boundary taking any change in building element or spaces on the other side into account. It can be further distinguished into 2 nd level type A There is a space on the other side. 2 nd level type B There is a building element on the other side. The exact definition of how space boundaries are broken down depends on the view definition, more detailed conventions on how space boundaries are decomposed can only be given at the domain or application type level. In an architectural or FM related view, a space boundary is defined totally from inside the space. This is a 1st level space boundary. In a thermal view, the decomposition of the space boundary depends on the material of the providing building element and the adjacent spaces behind. This is a 2nd level space boundary.

msgid "IfcProfileDef_DEFINITION"
msgstr "[[IfcProfileDef]] is the supertype of all definitions of standard and arbitrary profiles within IFC. It is used to define a standard set of commonly used section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry. Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross sections by a description of its parameters. Arbitrary profiles are cross sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also include holes, defined by inner boundaries. Derived profiles, based on a transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile definitions available. In addition composite profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions to define the resulting profile. HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5, the capabilities have been extended in IFC2x. Profiles can now support swept surfaces and swept area solids with inner boundaries. It had been renamed from IfcAttDrivenProfileDef. .change ifc2x4 IFC4 CHANGE Changed from ABSTRACT to non abstract for uses which do not require an explicitly defined geometry. Added inverse attributes HasProperties and HasExternalReference . Use in material association Beams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition, by means of [[IfcRelAssociatesMaterial]] together with [[IfcMaterialProfileSet]] and [[IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage]] . This way, building elements and element types with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and association. The profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with shape representations of the respective building elements. A higher level description of spatial aligment of the section profile of a member such as centered, bottom left, in the geometric centroid, and more can be provided within [[IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage]] by means of a cardinal point reference. This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent. Use in shape models Profile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or sectioned spines. The purpose of the profile definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define a uniform cross section being swept along a line extrusion using [[IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion]] or [[IfcExtrudedAreaSolid]] along a circular arc revolution using [[IfcSurfaceOfRevolution]] or [[IfcRevolvedAreaSolid]] along a directrix lying on a reference surface using [[IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid]] The purpose of the profile definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype [[IfcDerivedProfileDef]] is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the identity of vertices and edges. NOTE Subtypes of the [[IfcProfileDef]] contain parameterized profiles as subtypes of [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]] which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given by explicit curve geometry either open or closed profiles and two special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a 2D Cartesian transformation. An [[IfcProfileDef]] is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The attribute ProfileType is set to AREA. An [[IfcProfileDef]] is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this case, the inside of the profile if the curve is closed is not part of the profile. The attribute ProfileType is set to CURVE. Figure 1 illustrates use of parameterized profiles within a swept area solid. Position The [[IfcProfileDef]] is defined within the underlying coordinate system which is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of [[IfcSweptSurface]].Position or of [[IfcSweptAreaSolid]].Position or of each list member of [[IfcSectionedSpine]].CrossSectionPositions. In the figure to the left, the z axis of the position coordinate system points outwards of the drawing plane. Note The subtype [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]] optionally provides an additional 2D position coordinate system relative to the underlying coordinate system of the [[IfcProfileDef]]. Sweeping In the later use of the [[IfcProfileDef]] within the swept surface or swept area solid, e.g. the [[IfcExtrudedAreaSolid]] here used as an example , the profile boundaries here based on the 2D position coordinate system of [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]] are placed within the xy plane of the 3D position coordinate system of the swept surface or swept area solid. The profile is inserted into the underlying coordinate system either directly in case of using [[IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef]] and [[IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef]], through an intermediate position coordinate system in case of using [[IfcParameterizedProfileDef]]. through an 2D Cartesian transformation operator applied directly to the curve position when using arbitrary profile definitions, or applied to the position coordinate system when using parameterized profile definitions in case of using [[IfcDerivedProfileDef]]. when using [[IfcCompositeProfileDef]] the insertion depends on the subtype of the included sub profiles. Figure 1 Profile sweeping Profile types Results of the different usage of the ProfileType attribute are demonstrated here. The ProfileType defines whether the inside the bounded area is part of the profile definition Area or not Curve . Figure 2 illustrates the resulting area or curve depending on ProfileType . ProfileType AREA ProfileType CURVE Figure 2 Profile types Profile specification by external reference If the profile is standardized by a norm or a catalogue, a reference to this norm or catalogue should be provided by means of HasExternalReference . This inverse relationship is used to associate an [[IfcExternalReference]] notably [[IfcClassificationReference]] or [[IfcLibraryReference]] with the profile. [[IfcClassificationReference]] is used to refer to a profile norm a common standard or manufacturer s standard . In this case, [[IfcClassificationReference]].ItemReference contains the formal profile designation from the norm. On the other hand, [[IfcProfileDef]].ProfileName contains a displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation. [[IfcClassificationReference]].Name carries the short name of the profile norm. Optionally, the norm can be further described by [[IfcClassificationReference]].ReferencedSource . [[IfcLibraryReference]] is used to refer to a library which contains profile definitions. In this case, [[IfcLibraryReference]].ItemReference contains the identifier of the profile within the library and is meant to be machine readable in contrast to [[IfcProfileDef]].ProfileName which should be human readable . [[IfcLibraryReference]].Location and . Name or . ReferencedLibrary further describe the library. If an external reference is provided, sending systems shall ensure that the shape of the profile definition object agrees with the definitions in the referenced classification or library. Direct instances of [[IfcProfileDef]] Usually, only subtypes of [[IfcProfileDef]] should be instantiated. In some special cases, e.g. if the profile object is used for purposes other than geometric models e.g. for structural analysis models , it may be possible to directly instantiate [[IfcProfileDef]] and further specify the profile only by external reference or by profile properties. The latter are tracked by the inverse attribute HasProperties . bSI Documentation"

The [[IfcPropertyTableValue]] defines a defining defined property value combination for which the property name, the table with defining and defined values with measure type and optional the units for defining and defined values are given. NOTE The [[IfcPropertyTableValue]] only captures properties that can be expressed by a table with two columns. Use [[IfcPropertyReferenceValue]] with the PropertyReference being an [[IfcTable]] to express all those properties that require a table with tree or more columns. The units are handled by the DefiningUnit and DefinedUnit attributes, see Table 1 for an example of a table value property If the DefiningUnit or DefinedUnit attribute is not given, then the unit is already implied by the type of [[IfcMeasureValue]] or [[IfcDerivedMeasureValue]] .

msgstr "The distribution element [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] defines occurrence elements of a building automation control system that are used to impart control over elements of a distribution system. [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] defines elements of a building automation control system. These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows Impart control over flow control elements [[IfcFlowController]] in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation [[IfcActuator]] . Sensing elements [[IfcSensor]] that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow. Controllers [[IfcController]] typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control. Since [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] , the objectified relationship [[IfcRelFlowControlElements]] has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required. The key distinction between [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] and [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between [[IfcFlowMeter]] subtype of [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] measuring a flow quantity and [[IfcFlowInstrument]] subtype of [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] measuring a flow quality , is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures having inlet outlet pipes for the measured substance follows the [[IfcDistributionFlowElement]] hierarchy and therefore [[IfcFlowMeter]] which measures the flow internally . Otherwise, if it monitors controls but does not connect inline within the flow system it is external or is a component of another device , then it follows the [[IfcDistributionControlElement]] hierarchy and therefore [[IfcFlowInstrument]] which may display various attributes through connected sensors .

However, these small parts may have vital and load carrying functions within the construction. These items do not provide any actual space boundaries. Typical examples of IfcElementComponents include different kinds of fasteners and various accessories. One or several instances of subtypes of [[IfcElementComponent]] should always be accompanied by a defining instance of a respective subtype of [[IfcElementComponentType]]. The type object holds shape and material information. HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2 It is often desirable to model a number of same shaped element components by means of a single occurrence object, e.g. several bolts within a connection or a row of reinforcement elements. In this IFC release, this is possible by means of multiple mapped representation as documented below. To express the multiplicity of element components also on a higher semantic level, a Qto ElementComponentPatternQuantities should be provided via [[IfcRelDefinesByProperties]] and contain the number of pieces which are placed by a single [[IfcElementComponent]] instance. Symbolic Representation A symbolic representation is defined for a row of components or several rows of components within a single instance of [[IfcElementComponent]]. Such rows or arrays may contain possibly large numbers of individual pieces. The product definition shape consists of an [[IfcShapeRepresentation]] with the attribute values RepresentationIdentifier Row RepresentationType GeometricCurveSet and one or several curves as geometric items. The curves represent where reference points of the pieces are located. For example, such reference points may be at the heads of mechanical fasteners or at the starting point of the extrusion axis of reinforcement bars. In case of straight components bolts, nails, staples, straight reinforcement bars, or similar , the local placement of the [[IfcElementComponent]] shall be located and oriented such that the local z axis is parallel with the axes of the components. A Qto ElementComponentPatternQuantities should denote the count of pieces in the row or array and their spacing. bSI Documentation"

An [[IfcCostItem]] can be used to represent the cost of goods and services, the execution of works by a process, lifecycle cost and more. Each instance of [[IfcCostItem]] may have a name and a description. Depending on the use for which the cost is intended, these values should be asserted on the basis of agreement. For instance, the Name attribute could be used to provide a common value that enables distinct instances to be brought together in a nesting arrangement see below while the Description attribute may be used to provide text used for item description in a costing schedule. An [[IfcCostItem]] can link one or many [[IfcCostValue]] s representing a unit cost, total cost, or a unit cost with one or many quantities used to generate the total cost. The quantities can be given as individual quantities, or those quantities are provided as element quantities by one or many building elements. The [[IfcCostValue]].CostType attribute indicates the category of cost, which may be used to present the value in a particular column. For nested cost items having [[IfcRelNests]] relationship , [[IfcCostValue]].CostType is significant such that [[IfcCostValue]].AppliedValue is calculated as the sum of all nested costs having the same [[IfcCostValue]].CostType or if set to an asterisk , then the sum of all nested costs of all cost types. An [[IfcCostValue]] may represent an original value or a value derived from formulas using IfcAppliedValueRelationship . For example, taxes may be calculated as a percentage of a subtotal.

It encompasses certain general properties such as analysis type , references to all contained structural members, structural supports or connections, as well as loads and the respective load results. Important functionalities for the description of an analysis model are derived from existing IFC entities From [[IfcSystem]] it inherits the ability to couple the built system via [[IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure]] to one or more [[IfcSpatialElement]] subtypes as necessary. From [[IfcGroup]] it inherits the inverse attribute IsGroupedBy, pointing to the relationship class [[IfcRelAssignsToGroup]] . This allows the grouping of structural members instances of [[IfcStructuralMember]] , and supports instances of [[IfcStructuralConnection]] which belong to a specific analysis model. NOTE Loads as instances of [[IfcStructuralAction]] are not included through IsGroupedBy. Loads are assigned through the LoadedBy attribute relationship, using load groups as a grouping mechanism.

NOTE Results as instances of [[IfcStructuralReaction]] are not included through IsGroupedBy.

Coordinate Systems The following coordinate systems are distinguished The so called global coordinate system is the coordinate system shared by all items and activities which are grouped in a common [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] . This coordinate system is established by SELF [[IfcProduct]].ObjectPlacement . This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the [[IfcProject]] s world coordinate system. The so called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item connection or member . This coordinate system is established by a Representation attribute inherited from [[IfcProduct]] in conjunction with further use definitions and attributes of subtypes of [[IfcStructuralItem]] . Representation items in topology representations are always given within the ObjectPlacement , i.e. in so called global coordinates global with respect to the [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] to which this item belongs . The usage of local coordinate systems is further defined in subtypes. Topology Use Definitions Instances of [[IfcStructuralItem]] shall have a topology representation. It includes a placement and a product representation. The [[IfcProductRepresentation]] shall be given by an item in a Representation of type [[IfcTopologyRepresentation]] . Local Placement The local placement for [[IfcStructuralItem]] is defined in its supertype [[IfcProduct]] . It is defined by the [[IfcLocalPlacement]] , which establishes a global coordinate system which shall be common to all items and activities in an [[IfcStructuralAnalysisModel]] . Topology Representation Instances of [[IfcStructuralItem]] shall have a topology representation given by an instance of a subtype of [[IfcTopologicalRepresentationItem]] , which should be the single item of [[IfcTopologyRepresentation]].Items . Depending on the dimensionality of the structural item, one of the following types of toplogical representation items shall be used Point connections shall be represented by an [[IfcVertexPoint]] with an underlying [[IfcCartesianPoint]] .

The following labels are used in the [[IfcTopologyRepresentation]] RepresentationIdentifier Reference RepresentationType Vertex Curve members and curve connections shall either be represented by an [[IfcOrientedEdge]] , [[IfcEdgeCurve]] , or [[IfcEdge]] . The curve to which the [[IfcEdgeCurve]] or an [[IfcOrientedEdge]] s underlying [[IfcEdgeCurve]] refers to is the reference curve of the structural item in the global coordinate system. Start and end vertex of the edge shall be [[IfcVertexPoint]] s with underlying [[IfcCartesianPoint]] s. The following labels are used in the [[IfcTopologyRepresentation]] RepresentationIdentifier Reference RepresentationType Edge NOTE While an [[IfcEdge]] or [[IfcOrientedEdge]] with underlying [[IfcEdge]] does not provide an explicit underlying curve geometry, it may be used to imply an underlying straight line as reference curve with the origin of the curve parameter at the start vertex point. Surface members and surface connections shall be represented by an [[IfcFaceSurface]] . The underlying surface defines the reference surface of the structural surface item in the global coordiante system. All edges in the bounds of the face shall conform to the rules for edge representations of structural curve item. The following labels are used in the [[IfcTopologyRepresentation]] RepresentationIdentifier Reference RepresentationType Face The reference point, reference curve, or reference surface partially or completely defines the local coordinate system of the represented structural item according to the following rules. In all cases, The local x,y,z directions form a right handed Cartesian coordinate system. Structural point items The reference point in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item. The axes of the local coordiante system are either parallel with and directed like the so called global coordinate axes, or are oriented according to definitions at the respective subtype of [[IfcStructuralItem]] . Structural curve items The u parameter origin of the reference curve in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item. The local x axis is parallel with the tangent on the curve and directed like the u parameter direction. The local y and z axes are oriented according to definitions at the respective subtypes of [[IfcStructuralItem]] . Structural surface items The u,v parameter origin of the reference surface in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item.

If the shell has a domain with coordinate space R3, it divides that space into two connected regions, one finite and the other infinite. In this case, the topological normal of the shell is defined as being directed from the finite to the infinite region. The shell is represented by a collection of faces. The domain of the shell, if present, contains all those faces, together with their bounds. Associated with each face in the shell is a logical value which indicates whether the face normal agrees with TRUE or is opposed to FALSE the shell normal. The logical value can be applied directly as a BOOLEAN attribute of an oriented face, or be defaulted to TRUE if the shell boundary attribute member is a face without the orientation attribute. The combinatorial restrictions on closed shells and geometrical restrictions on their domains are designed to ensure that any domain associated with a closed shell is a closed, orientable manifold. The domain of a closed shell, if present, is a connected, closed, oriented 2 manifold. It is always topologically equivalent to an H fold torus for some H 0. The number H is referred to as the surface genus of the shell. If a shell of genus H has a domain within coordinate space R 3 , then the finite region of space inside it is topologically equivalent to a solid ball with H tunnels drilled through it. The Euler equation applies with B 0, because in this case there are no holes. As in the case of open shells, the surface genus H may not be known a priori, but shall be an integer 0. Thus a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a well formed closed shell is the following Image .. .. .. .. .. .. figures ifcopenshell math1.gif NOTE Entity adapted from closed shell defined in ISO 10303 42.

In the most common case of swinging doors the [[IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum]] defined the hinge side left hung or right hung and the opening direction opening to the left, opening to the right . Whether the door opens inwards or outwards is determined by the local coordinate system of the [[IfcDoor]] REMOVE , or [[IfcDoorStandardCase]] .

Therefore the IFC definition terms may derive from the local standard and may need to be mapped appropriately.

Another usage is exact or approximate global positioning against a geographic coordinate systems using longitude and latitude. NOTE While the unit of measurement of the type [[IfcPlaneAngleMeasure]] depends on unit assignment radian or degree or other derived units globally at the IfcPoject or locally at an [[IfcMeasureWithUnit]] , the units of [[IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure]] are always degrees, minutes, seconds, and millionth seconds irrespective of unit assignments. HISTORY New type in IFC1.5.1. Type LIST 3 4 OF INTEGER .use head Value restrictions The first integer measure is the number of degrees and is generally not range restricted. However, when [[IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure]] is used to express geographic coordinates, only latitudes of 90, 90 and longitudes of 180, 180 are used in practice. The second integer measure is the number of minutes and shall be in the range 60, 60 . The third integer measure is the number of seconds and shall be in the range 60, 60 .

msgstr "The [[IfcFontWeight]] type defines the weight of the font. Values are normal bold 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 .extDef NOTE Definition according to Cascading Style Sheets, level 1 The values 100 to 900 form an ordered sequence, where each number indicates a weight that is at least as dark as its predecessor. The keyword normal is synonymous with 400 , and bold is synonymous with 700 . Keywords other than normal and bold have been shown to be often confused with font names and a numerical scale was therefore chosen for the 9 value list. .extDef Fonts the font data typically have one or more properties whose values are names that are descriptive of the weight of a font. There is no accepted, universal meaning to these weight names. Their primary role is to distinguish faces of differing darkness within a single font family. Usage across font families is quite variant for example a font that you might think of as being bold might be described as being Regular, Roman, Book, Medium, Semi or DemiBold, Bold, or Black, depending on how black the normal face of the font is within the design. Because there is no standard usage of names, the weight property values in CSS1 are given on a numerical scale in which the value 400 or normal corresponds to the normal text face for that family. The weight name associated with that face will typically be Book, Regular, Roman, Normal or sometimes Medium . .extDef The association of other weights within a family to the numerical weight values is intended only to preserve the ordering of darkness within that family. However, the following heuristics tell how the assignment is done in typical cases If the font family already uses a numerical scale with nine values such as with OpenType , the font weights should be mapped directly. If there is both a face labeled Medium and one labeled Book, Regular, Roman or Normal, then the Medium is normally assigned to the 500 . The font labeled Bold will often correspond to the weight value 700 . If there are fewer then 9 weights in the family, the default algorithm for filling the holes is as follows. If 500 is unassigned, it will be assigned the same font as 400 . If any of the values 600 , 700 , 800 or 900 remains unassigned, they are assigned to the same face as the next darker assigned keyword, if any, or the next lighter one otherwise. If any of 300 , 200 or 100 remains unassigned, it is assigned to the next lighter assigned keyword, if any, or the next darker otherwise. .extDef The following two examples illustrate the process. Assume four weights in the Example1 family, from lightest to darkest Regular, Medium, Bold, Heavy. And assume six weights in the Example2 family Book, Medium, Bold, Heavy, Black, ExtraBlack.

msgstr "An [[IfcGloballyUniqueId]] holds an encoded string identifier that is used to uniquely identify an IFC object. An [[IfcGloballyUniqueId]] is a Globally Unique Identifier GUID which is an auto generated 128 bit number. Since this identifier is required for all IFC object instances, it is desirable to compress it to reduce overhead. The encoding of the base 64 character set is shown below 1 2 3 4 5 6 X 09 X 09 0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123 X 09 X 09 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz The resulting string is a fixed 22 character length string to be exchanged within the IFC exchange file structure. NOTE Refer to the BuildingSMART website www.buildingsmart tech.org http www.buildingsmart tech.org for more information and sample encoding algorithms.
